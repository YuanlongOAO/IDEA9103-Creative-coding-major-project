### How to trigger the animation

When the sketch first loads, the image is shown as a static 64×64 colour-block mosaic reconstructed from the original Mondrian painting.
Press **`A`** on the keyboard to **toggle the animation on/off**:
Before pressing `A`: only the static mosaic is visible.
After pressing `A`: the colour blocks start to move chromatically, and colourful trails begin to “draw” over the image.
